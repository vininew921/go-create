# go-create


I was tired of doing `mkdir module_name && go mod init module_name` so this was created.


## Usage


### Clone
Run `git clone https://github.com/vininew921/go-create`


### Install
Run `go install .`


### Running
Run `go-create <mod_name>`

This will create a directory where the command was ran with the name `mod_name`, initialize a go module with the same name and create a basic `main.go`
