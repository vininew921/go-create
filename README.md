# go-create


I was tired of doing `mkdir module_name && go mod init module_name` so this was created.


## Usage


Clone locally: `git clone https://github.com/vininew921/go-create`


Install: `go install .`


Usage: `go-create module_name`
This will create a directory where the command was ran with the name `module_name`, initialize a go module with the same name and create a basic `main.go`
